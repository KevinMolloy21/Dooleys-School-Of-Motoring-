			<h2>Charlotte Merrigan: 18</h2><br><h3> Con was an amazing instructor from start to finish. He was very accommodating and patient and by my third lesson I really felt like I had a good handle on the roads, passed my test first time around!</h3>
				<br><h2>Adam Molloy: 19</h2><br><h3> I went to Con as a learner driver hoping to get my test done quickly, through his practical knowledge and thorough understanding of the roads, I was able to pass my test first go.</h3>
				<br><h2>Rahul Dev: 37</h2><br><h3> Before I came to Con, I had very bad habits which i didn’t think could be reversed. Con was able to explain things to me in a way that was easy to understand and master such as the use of the clutch. Would highly recommend for both learner and experienced drivers who are looking to better their driving skills.</h3>
				<br><h2>Emma Cetin: 19</h2><br><h3> I’m from a small rural area and was not used to driving on city roads, I had no knowledge of Galway let alone the roads but with Con’s help I was soon able to drive around Galway like Lewis Hamilton!</h3>
